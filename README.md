# Improving-the-classification-accuracy-in-the-case-of-Unbalanced-dataset

Credit card payment is one of the prevalent means of transactions carried out in both online and offline 
purchases.With the latest technology and worldwide communications, fraud has increased significantly. 
 
Credit card based online payments have grown intensely, compelling financial organizations to
implement and continuously improve their fraud detection system. However, credit card fraud dataset is
heavily imbalanced and different types of misclassification errors may have different costs and it is essential
to control them, to a certain degree, to compromise those errors.
 
The dataset has been taken frоm Kaggle аnd саtegоrize intо trаining (80%) аnd testing (20%) 
dаtа. The main aim of this work is to optimize XGBoost (OXGBoost) approach to handle class imbalance in
the datasets with using resampling techniques
